# Flutter App with Supabase Backend

This Flutter application integrates with **Supabase** to provide user authentication and data management. It includes features such as login, signup, and user-specific data storage, allowing users to manage their data independently.

## Features

  Users can log in and sign up using their credentials. The authentication is powered by Supabase.

- **User-Specific Data Management**:  
  Each user has their own separate data, ensuring privacy and isolation.

- **CRUD Functionality**:  
  Users can:
  - **Create**: Add new records.
  - **Read**: View existing records.
  - **Update**: Modify existing records.
  - **Delete**: Remove records they no longer need.

## Tech Stack
